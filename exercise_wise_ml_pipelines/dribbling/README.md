# Dribbling

This exercise probably has the most intriguing approach, so make sure to read this one carefully. 

## Things to check

1. We might want to add left hand and right hand data later on to catch the anomalous motion sooner. By tracking just the ball, we might also classify the bouncing away from the student (in case the student misses the ball) as a dribble. I haven't done this yet due to the lack of both right handed and left handed data, to help avoid bias in the model.
